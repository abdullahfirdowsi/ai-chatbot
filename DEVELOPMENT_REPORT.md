# üìã Development Report: VizTalk AI Tutor Chatbot with RAG

## üéØ Executive Summary

I have successfully developed a **VizTalk AI Tutor Chatbot** featuring **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** capabilities. This intelligent tutoring system combines document-based knowledge retrieval with AI-powered responses to provide contextual, accurate answers from uploaded educational materials.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture & Implementation

### **Backend Infrastructure (FastAPI + Python)**
- **Framework:** FastAPI with async/await support for high performance
- **AI Engine:** Groq's Llama-3.1-8B-Instant model for fast LLM inference
- **Vector Database:** FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) for semantic document search
- **Document Processing:** LangChain framework with support for PDF, TXT, DOCX, and Markdown
- **Embeddings:** HuggingFace Sentence Transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) for 384-dimensional vectors
- **Database:** MongoDB for conversation history and metadata storage

### **Frontend Application (Angular + Material UI)**
- **Framework:** Angular 20+ with TypeScript for type-safe development  
- **UI Components:** Angular Material Design for professional interface
- **Features:** Dual chat modes, document management, knowledge base analytics
- **Real-time Updates:** Reactive programming with RxJS observables

## üß† RAG Implementation Details

### **How the RAG System Works:**

1. **Document Ingestion Pipeline**
   - Users upload documents (PDF/TXT/DOCX/MD files up to 10MB)
   - Documents are automatically chunked using RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter (1000 chars with 200 overlap)
   - Text chunks are converted to 384-dimensional embeddings using sentence transformers
   - Embeddings stored in persistent FAISS vector database with metadata

2. **Intelligent Query Processing**
   - User questions are converted to embeddings for semantic similarity matching
   - FAISS performs vector similarity search to find top 5 most relevant document chunks
   - Retrieved context is injected into LLM prompts with conversation history
   - Groq's LLM generates contextually-aware responses with source citations

3. **Dual Chat Architecture**
   - **Standard Mode:** General AI tutoring without document context
   - **RAG Mode:** Enhanced responses using uploaded knowledge base
   - **Automatic Fallback:** Graceful degradation when no relevant context found
